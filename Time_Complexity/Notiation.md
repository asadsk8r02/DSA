# Big O Notation (O)

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's runtime or complexity. It gives the worst-case scenario of how an algorithm's performance scales with the size of the input. For example, if an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n2)O(n^2)O(n2), it means that in the worst case, the time taken by the algorithm grows proportionally to the square of the input size.

# Omega Notation (Ω)

Omega notation represents the lower bound of an algorithm's runtime. It gives the best-case scenario or the minimum time an algorithm will take, regardless of the input. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Ω(n)\Omega(n)Ω(n), it means that in the best case, the time taken by the algorithm will grow at least linearly with the input size.

# Theta Notation (Θ)

Theta notation provides a tight bound on the algorithm's runtime, meaning it describes both the upper and lower bounds. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(n)\Theta(n)Θ(n), it means that the time taken by the algorithm grows linearly with the input size, both in the best and worst cases. In other words, Theta notation implies that the algorithm's runtime is both O(n)O(n)O(n) and Ω(n)\Omega(n)Ω(n).
